# VGLeadSheets for Android

The mobile companion to the website www.vgleadsheets.com. Offers a mobile-tailored experience for viewing sheet music from video games, designed specifically for jam sessions (both the app and the sheets).

## Building

VGLeadSheets should build and install just like any other Android app:

```./gradlew :app:installDebug```

Firebase features are also enabled automatically if you supply a `google-services.json` file.
